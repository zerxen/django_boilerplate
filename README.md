# Personal Django2.x + Python3 boilerplate

This is my personal boiler plate that holds an empty shell python project with:
- MySQL settings
- Basic reactive CSS template (integrating responsive CSS layer + responsive CCS menu example)
- User management via admin 

### TODO: 
- user registration + activation link sending via email (python)

# INSTALL & FIRST RUN

You have to have python3 installed, then install django using "pip install Django"

Following that, you can try running this boilerplate as "python manage.py runserver 8080" and you can then open browser to go to http://localhost:8080

Additionally, because this is MY boiler plate, there will be LiClipse IDE project files inside this repository as that is the free IDE I am using here.
