# Personal Django2.x + Python3 boilerplate

This is my personal boiler plate that holds an empty shell python project with:
- MySQL settings
- Basic reactive CSS template (integrating responsive CSS layer + responsive CCS menu example)
- User management via admin 

### TODO: 
- user registration + activation link sending via email (python)
